# BoostBot - Helipad to Nostr Webhook Bot

> **Note**: This is my custom version with advanced features. For a stripped-down starter version, see [BoostBot Starter](https://github.com/ChadFarrow/BoostBot-Starter).

## Requirements

**Helipad and Alby Hub are required for this project.**

- Helipad is a simple LND poller and web front-end to see and read boosts and boostagrams.
- BoostBot receives webhooks from Helipad and posts boosts to Nostr.
- You must have Helipad running and configured to send webhooks to BoostBot.
- Get Helipad here: [https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/helipad](https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/helipad)
- **You will also need Alby Hub running on your node.**
  - Alby Hub is available in the app stores of [Umbrel](https://umbrel.com/) and [Start9](https://start9.com/).
  - See the Alby Hub guide: [https://guides.getalby.com/user-guide/alby-hub/alby-hub-flavors/umbrel-start9-etc](https://guides.getalby.com/user-guide/alby-hub/alby-hub-flavors/umbrel-start9-etc)
- **Helipad is most commonly run on:**
  - [Start9](https://start9.com/)
  - [Umbrel](https://umbrel.com/)
  - [RaspiBlitz](https://github.com/raspiblitz/raspiblitz)

**Note:** Currently, BoostBot only posts **sent boosts** to Nostr. Support for received boosts and streams may be added in the future.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Security Disclaimer:** I recommend creating a new set of Nostr keys for this bot so you don't leak your personal ones.

**üì± Compatible Apps:** This only works with apps that use Lightning payments: Alby, Podverse, PodcastGuru, CurioCaster, Castamatic, and LNBeats. Find more compatible apps at [https://podcasting2.org/apps](https://podcasting2.org/apps).
